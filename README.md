# bootstrap-admin-ui

Fork of [rdash/rdash-angular](https://github.com/rdash/rdash-angular) that is a demo of [beeman/bootstrap-admin-ui](https://github.com/beeman/bootstrap-admin-ui.git)

## Usage
### Requirements
* [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) (with [NPM](https://www.npmjs.org/))
* [Bower](http://bower.io)
* [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/beeman/bootstrap-admin-angular.git`
2. Install the NodeJS dependencies: `npm install`.
3. Install the Bower dependencies: `bower install`.
4. Run the gulp build task: `gulp build`.
5. Run the gulp default task: `gulp`. This will build any changes made automatically, and also run a live reload server on [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888).

Ensure your preferred web server points towards the `dist` directory.

### Development
Continue developing the dashboard further by editing the `src` directory. With the `gulp` command, any file changes made will automatically be compiled into the specific location within the `dist` directory.

#### Modules & Packages
By default, bootstrap-admin-angular includes [`ui.bootstrap`](http://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/), [`ui.router`](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router) and [`ngCookies`](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngCookies). 

If you'd like to include any additional modules/packages not included with bootstrap-admin-angular, add them to your `bower.json` file and then update the `src/index.html` file, to include them in the minified distribution output.
